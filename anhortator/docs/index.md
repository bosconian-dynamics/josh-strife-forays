# Josh Strife Forays

A Morrowind mod introducing the YouTuber and video essayist [Josh Strife Hayes](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshStrifeHayes) as a companion NPC, featuring voiced excerpts from [his Morrowind playthrough streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxBn8vzknPj8puaWvsA72_OqaphEw-7MJ).

This is an unofficial fan/community venture - contributions of all sorts are welcome! Project coordination and development of the mod itself (working on the Morrowind plugin files, OpenMW LUA, mesh and texture assets, etc.) occurs on [GitHub](https://github.com/bosconian-dynamics/josh-strife-forays). Drop in to the [Josh Strife Hayes Discord](https://discord.gg/HCPzJ3ntJ2) for general discussion. All contributors are credited within the project repository as well as in the mod itself.

The Anhortator tool was built for the specific purpose of enabling community members to more easily contribute to this project; it too is open source and welcomes contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/bosconian-dynamics/anhortator).

## How to Get Involved

The work performed here on Anhortator consists of several different tasks:

- Identifying interesting slices of stream audio ("cuts") which would make for compelling lines for our NPC Josh.
- Classifying cuts with tags to aid in sorting out the conditions which might lead to NPC Josh speaking the line in-game.
- Improving cuts' transcripts for use as captions in-game.
- Cleaning up cuts of stream audio using software such as Audacity or Adobe Audition to isolate Josh's voice from the game audio.

You can engage with any aspects which appeal to you. Anhortator is intended to enable community-wide collaboration on every cut; it's not necessary to get involved with every task - every bit of work helps the project move forward.

### Marking Cuts

When possible, try to include up to a few seconds of audio where Josh is not speaking on either side of the cut. Such isolated game audio can be useful in the process of separating out Josh's voice.

### Classification

#### Meta

Cuts with subject matter which "breaks the fourth wall" by way of explicitly referencing Morrowind or it's mechanics as a video game - or otherwise unambiguously referencing the real world - should be tagged with "Meta". The mod may provide an option to enable/disable fourth-wall-breaking content for the sake of immersion, or a means to do so through gameplay.

### Transcription

The base transcripts I've managed to dig up for each stream are pretty abysmal, and lack even the level of precision and timing offered by YouTube's auto-generated captions. A newly created cut will capture

### Audio Work

While the audio distributed with the mod will likely be packaged in a lower-quality lossy format, cut revisions submitted to Anhortator should be 44100 KHz stereo WAV files in a best effort to preserve quality for potential future revisions.
